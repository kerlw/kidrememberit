## RoadMap
Step 1:

* show some cards to kids for a short time, then hide these cards, let the kids try to select out the correct card from a card list in the correct order.
* number of cards, length of card showing time, time length for permutation is the 3 factors of difficulty.
* each puzzle should be generated randomly, and there should be an algorithm to calculate the difficulty factor according to kids answer, make it step by step.

Step 2:

* the classic memory game: show cards to kids with the back side, trying to clear these card by flipping tow same cards.
* number of cards, time length for flipping is 2 factors of difficulty
